==========

The Distributed SVRG tool is a parallelization of the SVRG algorithm on top of DMTK parameter server (For more details, please view the DMTK website [http://www.dmtk.io](http://www.dmtk.io)). It provides an efficient "scaling to industry size" solution for SVRG and can solve linear and logistic model.
